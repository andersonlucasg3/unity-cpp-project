# unity-cpp-project

Just a POC demonstrating how we could have all Unity API in Cpp even without their consent.

There is a NativeInitializer class in the managed code (Unity C#).

There is a [method](CppSource/UnityCppLib/UnityAPI/UnityAPIExtern.cpp) called `NativeInitialized` in that does the tests.

Kisses everybody.
